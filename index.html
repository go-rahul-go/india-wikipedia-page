    <article class="introduction"> <!--Introduction-->
        <p>
            India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the
            seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the
            world.
            Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the
            southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
            Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
            Maldives;
            its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long
            occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
            second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western
            margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of
            the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused
            into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a
            resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian
            languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and
            exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social
            orders unlinked to heredity.Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta
            Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also
            marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of
            belief.In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to
            the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Ancient India</h3>
        <p>
            By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
            Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
            date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals,
            construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other
            sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[81] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley
            Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia,[83] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in
            what is now Pakistan and western India.[84] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira,
            and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts
            production and wide-ranging trade.<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures
            to the Iron Age ones.The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism, were composed
            during this period,and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and
            the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of
            Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[86] The caste system, which created a
            hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their
            occupations impure, arose during this period.On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this
            period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.In South India, a
            progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this
            period,as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.

        <h3>Medieval India</h3>
        <p>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural
            diversity.[108] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE,
            attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[109] When his successor
            attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[109] When the Chalukyas attempted
            to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the
            Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[109] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire
            and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[108] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose
            land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste
            society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[110] The caste system consequently began to show
            regional differences.[110]</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[111] They were
            imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern
            languages of the subcontinent.[111] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew
            citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[112] Temple towns of
            various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[112] By the 8th and 9th
            centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were
            exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam,
            Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[113] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in
            this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries
            and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.</p>
        <p>After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies
            united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually
            to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[114] The sultanate was to control much of North
            India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the
            sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[115][116] By
            repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation
            visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned
            men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a
            syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[117][118] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional
            kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[119] Embracing a strong
            Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control
            much of peninsular India,[120] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.</p>

        <h3>Early Modern India</h3>
        <p>In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[121] fell again to the superior
            mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[122] The resulting Mughal Empire did
            not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new
            administrative practices[123][124] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[125] leading to more systematic,
            centralised, and uniform rule.[126] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the
            Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an
            emperor who had near-divine status.[125] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from
            agriculture[127] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[128] caused
            peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[126] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much
            of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[126] resulting in greater patronage of
            painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[129] Newly coherent social groups in northern and
            western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions
            during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military
            experience.[130] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political
            elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[130] As the empire disintegrated, many among these
            elites were able to seek and control their own affairs</p>

            <figcaption>2 Mohurs Company gold coin issued in 1885</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly
            blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established
            coastal outposts.[132][133] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more
            advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it
            to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to
            gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[134][132][135][136]
            Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army
            enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[137] India was then no longer exporting
            manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many
            historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[132] By this time, with its economic
            power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British
            administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including
            education, social reform and culture.</p>

    <article>
        <h3>Modern India</h3>
        <p>Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848
            of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a
            modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the
            population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the
            telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[139][140][141][142] However,
            disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by
            diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and
            summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and
            central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[143][144] Although the rebellion was suppressed by
            1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the
            British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary
            system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future
            unrest.[145][146] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually
            to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.</p>
        <p>The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was
            marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[151]
            There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[152] and, despite the risks of infrastructure
            development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[153] There
            were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased
            food production for internal consumption.[154] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[155]
            notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[155] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.</p>

        <p>Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in
            place a secular and democratic republic.[160] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of
            the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[161] Economic liberalisation, which began in the
            1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing
            economies,[162] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian films, music, and spiritual teachings play an
            increasing role in global culture.[163] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both
            rural and urban;[163] by religious and caste-related violence;[164] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite
            insurgencies;[165] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[166] It has unresolved
            territorial disputes with China[167] and with Pakistan.[167] India's sustained democratic freedoms are
            unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from
            want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.</p>

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the
            Indo-Australian Plate.[169] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian
            Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor
            spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[169] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic
            crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[169] These dual processes, driven by
            convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust
            eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[169] Immediately south of the emerging
            Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne
            sediment[170] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[171] The original Indian plate makes its first
            appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a
            southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the
            Aravallis.

            Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra,
            both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[180] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and
            the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods
            and course changes.[181][182] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from
            flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of
            Bengal;[183] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[184] Coastal features include
            the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is
            shared with Bangladesh.[185] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's
            south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.

            Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the
            economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[187] The Himalayas prevent cold Central
            Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most
            locations at similar latitudes.[188][189] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the
            moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of
            India's rainfall.[187] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry,
            subtropical humid, and montane.[190]

            Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[191] Climate change in India is
            often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the
            major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[192] According to some current
            projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the
            present century

                India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity
                and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is a habitat for 8.6%
                of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of
                fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species
                are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[68] or regions that
                display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[j][200]

                According to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789 km2 (275,595 sq mi), which is 21.71%
                of the country's total land area.[69] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy
                density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[201] Very dense forest,
                whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[201][202] It predominates
                in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India.[195]
                Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land
                area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous
                sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[195] Open
                forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[201][202]
                India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western
                Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural
                land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.

                Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem,
                which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[204] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or
                peepul,[205] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[206] and under which the Buddha is
                recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[207]

                Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India
                separated more than 100 million years ago.[208] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass
                exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic
                Indian forms.[209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes
                flanking the Himalayas.[195] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which
                stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198] Among endemics
                are the vulnerable[210] hooded leaf monkey[211] and the threatened[212] Beddome's toad[212][213] of the
                Western Ghats.

                India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[214] These
                include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include:
                the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has
                become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[215] Before they were
                extensively utilized for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were
                mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the
                Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the
                cheetah is extinct.[216] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades
                has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected
                areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife
                Protection Act[217] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was
                enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[218] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife
                sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves,[219] four of which are part of the World Network of
                Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.

        <h3>Politics</h3>
        <div class="politics">
            <p>
                India is the world's most populous democracy.[222] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party
                system,[223] it has eight recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and
                the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[224] The Congress is considered
                centre-left in Indian political culture,[225] and the BJP right-wing.

            </p>
            <p>
                For most of the
                period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority
                in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the
                BJP,[229] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party
                coalition governments at the centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal
                Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became
                prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira
                Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public
                discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in
                1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted
                just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh.
                Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was
                assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general
                elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led
                by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too
                proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this
                period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[231] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute
                majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V.
                Narasimha Rao.
            </p>
            <p>
                A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived
                alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by
                two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were
                two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to
                form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the
                NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.

                Again in the
                2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the
                largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA).
            </p>
            <p>
                It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the
                2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's
                communist parties.[234] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru
                in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2014 general election,
                the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of
                other parties.[236] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime
                minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was
                elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2022.

                India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country's
                supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which "majority
                rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law". Federalism in India defines the power
                distribution between the union and the states.
                <br>The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[239] originally stated India
                to be a "sovereign, democratic republic;" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to "a sovereign,
                socialist, secular, democratic republic".
                <br>
                India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak
                states,[241] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and
                social changes.
            </p>
            <h4>The Government of India comprises three branches:</h4>
            <h5>1.Executive</h5>
            <p>
                The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[245] who is elected indirectly for a five-year
                term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[246][247] The Prime
                Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[248] Appointed by the
                president,[249] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having
                a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[248] The executive of the Indian government
                consists of the president, the vice president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being
                its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member
                of one of the houses of parliament.[245] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is
                subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the
                lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the
                executive are implemented by them.
            </p>
            <h5>2.Legislature</h5>
            <p>
                The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary
                system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called
                the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[251] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve
                staggered six-year terms.

                Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to
                their state's share of the national population.[249] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are
                elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[253]
                Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped.
            </p>
            <h5>3.Judiciary</h5>
            <p>
                India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[256] comprising the supreme court, headed by the
                Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[256] The supreme court has
                original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the
                centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[257] It has the power to both strike down

                India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[16] All states, as well as the
                union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have
                elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five
                union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In
                1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[260] There are
                over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.

                In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in
                the
                Non-Aligned Movement.[263] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war
                with
                China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[264] India has had tense relations with
                neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three
                of
                these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed
                from
                India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[265] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice
                intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between
                1987
                and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the Maldives. After the
                1965
                war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the
                late
                1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[266]

                Aside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[267] India has wide-ranging defence relations
                with
                Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional
                Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police
                personnel
                to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia
                Summit,
                the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[268] India has close economic ties with countries in South
                America,[269] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a "Look East" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships
                with
                the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those
                involving
                economic investment and regional security.

                China's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the
                1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[273] India conducted its first nuclear weapons
                test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military
                sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear
                Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[274] India maintains a "no
                first use" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "Minimum
                Credible Deterrence" doctrine.[275][276] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a
                fifth-generation fighter jet.[277][278] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and
                implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[279]

                Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation
                with the United States and the European Union.[280] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed
                between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a
                party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy
                Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and
                commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[281] India
                subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[282]
                France,[283] the United Kingdom,[284] and Canada.
                The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45 million active
                troops, they compose the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy,
                the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[286] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was
                US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[287] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal
                year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[288][289] India is the world's second
                largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms
                imports.[290] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering
                growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[291] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation
                launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[292] In
                October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement with Russia to procure four
                S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence
                system.

                third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[297] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8%
                over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[298] India is one of the world's
                fastest-growing economies.[299] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita
                and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[300] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist
                policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation
                largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991
                forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[301] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market
                system[302][303] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[304] India has been a
                member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.

            <p>The 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2017.[286] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[306] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[307] Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[16] Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[16] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[302] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[308] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[309] Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[16] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[16] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[310] India was the world's second largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.</p>

                Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[302] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[312] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[313] Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness, as of 2010, India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[314] With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009, the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[315] India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2022.[316] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.

                Driven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,313 by 2022.[20] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.

                According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[318] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[318] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[318] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.
